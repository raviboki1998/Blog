The main difference between the rendering of ReactJS and Next.js is that Next.js supports server-side rendering (SSR), while ReactJS only supports client-side rendering (CSR).

**Reactjs:**

- React.js is a JavaScript library for building User Interfaces. It focuses on the view layer of the application, allowing developers to create reusable UI components and manage the state of these components efficiently. React operates on the client side and handles rendering in the browser.

**Client-side** **Rendering**  **(CSR):**

By default, React applications use client-side rendering, where the initial HTML page is loaded, and then JavaScript runs to render the UI components in the browser. This can sometimes lead to slower initial page loads and might not be very friendly for Search Engine Optimization (SEO).

**Next.js:**

Next.js is a framework built on top of React that adds additional features for server-side rendering, routing, and other optimizations. It simplifies the process of building server-rendered React applications and provides a comprehensive solution for creating production-ready applications.

**Server-side** **Rendering** **(SSR)** **by** **Default:**

 Next.js provides automatic Server-Side Rendering for pages by default. When a user requests a page, the server generates the HTML content, including React components' initial rendering, and sends it to the client. This can lead to faster initial page loads and better SEO.

**Client-side** **Rendering** **(CSR)** **when** **Needed:**

Next.js also supports Client-Side Rendering for specific components or parts of your application, allowing you to choose the appropriate rendering strategy for different parts of your application.

**Static** **Site** **Generation** **(SSG):** 

Next.js goes a step further by offering static site generation. With SSG, the server renders the pages at build time, generating static HTML files that can be served to users. This can greatly improve performance and reduces the need for server-side processing for every request.
